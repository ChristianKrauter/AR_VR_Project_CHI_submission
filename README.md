# AR_VR_Project_CHI_submission
This project was developed for the Course AR/VR at the University of Stuttgart.<br/>
We wanted to study the effect of different teleportation visualizations on the user.<br/>
Therefore we developed a little game, in which the goal has to be reached via multiple plattforms.
The only way of travelling in this game is teleportation.<br/>
During the end of the project we saw the running student game competition and changed our project to fit into the competition.
This repository is the final submission for this competition.
